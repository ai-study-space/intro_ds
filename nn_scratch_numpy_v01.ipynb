You have just learned how to create and train a neural network from scratch using PyTorch. There are so many things you can do with the shallow network we have just implemented. You can add more hidden layers or try to incorporate the bias terms for practice. I would love to see what you will build from here. Reach me out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/omarsar0) if you have any further questions or leave your comments here. Until next time!"
